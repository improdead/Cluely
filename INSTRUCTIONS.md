# Cluely ‚Äî Instructions

**Cluely** is an AI-powered executive coaching assistant for Apple Vision Pro that provides real-time, context-aware coaching hints during conversations and presentations.

## üéØ What is Cluely?

Cluely combines:
- **Go Backend**: WebSocket server with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text v2 + Gemini AI for intelligent micro-answers
- **visionOS Frontend**: Beautiful "liquid glass" UI with voice activity detection (VAD), audio streaming, and optional screen capture with OCR

The system listens to your conversations, analyzes what's being said (and optionally what's on screen), and provides strategic coaching hints in real-time.

## üìã Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Backend Requirements (Go Server):**
- Go 1.21+ installed
- **Gemini API Key** (required) - Get from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- **Google Cloud Credentials** (optional for Speech-to-Text):
  - GCP project with Speech-to-Text API enabled
  - Service account JSON with appropriate permissions
  - Environment variables: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`

**Frontend Requirements (visionOS Client):**
- macOS with Xcode 15+
- visionOS SDK installed
- Vision Pro device or visionOS Simulator

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Set Up Backend

```bash
cd server

# Set your Gemini API key (required)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Optional: Set Google Cloud credentials for Speech-to-Text
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"

# Build the server
go build -o bin/cluelyd ./cmd/cluelyd

# Run the server
./bin/cluelyd
```

The server will start on port 8080. You should see:
```
cluelyd listening :8080
[metrics] sessions=0 pcm(in=0 drop=0) asr(p=0 f=0) hints=0 followups=0 errors(asr=0 ans=0)
```

#### 2. Set Up Frontend

On macOS:

1. Open Xcode and create a new visionOS App project named "Cluely"
2. Drag the contents of `apps/visionos/CluelyApp/` into your Xcode project
3. Update `Info.plist` with your server URL:
   - Same Mac: `ws://localhost:8080/ws`
   - Different machine: `ws://<SERVER_IP>:8080/ws`
4. Build and run in visionOS Simulator or device
5. Grant microphone permission when prompted

## üß™ Testing

### Test Backend Only (No Frontend Required)

The easiest way to verify your backend works:

```bash
cd server

# Build and run the test client
go build -o bin/test ./cmd/test
./bin/test
```

This simulates a visionOS client and sends test scenarios with transcripts + OCR context. You should see intelligent, context-aware coaching hints.

**See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing instructions and troubleshooting.**

### Test Full End-to-End

With both backend and frontend running:

**Option A: Voice Activity Detection (Auto)**
- Speak near the microphone
- VAD will detect speech and show "Listening..." indicator
- Real-time transcription ‚Üí coaching hints appear
- Stops automatically after silence

**Option B: Manual Control**
- Tap "Start" to begin streaming
- Speak ‚Üí see transcripts and hints
- Tap "Stop" to end

**Option C: Demo Mode**
- Tap "Demo" button to send test transcript
- Verify hint appears in suggestion panel

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory or set environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | No | Model to use (default: `gemini-flash-lite-latest`) |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | No | Path to GCP service account JSON |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | No | Your Google Cloud project ID |

See `server/.env.example` for a complete template.

### Client Configuration

Update `apps/visionos/CluelyApp/Resources/Info.plist`:
- `WSURL`: WebSocket server address (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080/ws`)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"gemini status 401" or "403"**
- Your API key is invalid or expired
- Get a new key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Verify you copied the entire key (starts with `AI...`)

**Generic fallback hints appear**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` not set correctly
- Check server logs for error messages

**No ASR transcripts**
- Verify Google Cloud credentials are set
- Ensure Speech-to-Text API is enabled in GCP
- Check server logs for ASR errors

### Frontend Issues

**Client can't connect**
- Ensure server is running on expected host/port
- Check firewall rules (may block port 8080)
- Verify `Info.plist` WSURL matches server address

**VAD not triggering**
- Adjust thresholds in `VAD.swift` (`openDB`, `closeDB`)
- Verify microphone permission in Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security

**No hints appearing**
- Check server logs for Gemini errors
- Verify rate limiting (1 hint per 1.5s)
- Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set on server

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find process using port 8080
# macOS/Linux:
lsof -i :8080

# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Kill the process or use a different port
```

## üéâ What Makes Cluely Powerful

Cluely's enhanced Gemini prompt provides:

1. **Screen Content Awareness**: References actual OCR data from your presentations
